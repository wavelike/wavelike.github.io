This is a list of various selected personal projects and papers I read to give you an overview and for me to keep track:


## Personal Projects

#### Automatic Machine Learning System
- Generalisation of Machine Learning Pipeline tasks (from reading raw data to model optimisation)
- Setup of ML-pipelines fast and easy via configs and without writing code
- Usage of a feature store
- Automatic model selection, hyperparameter optimisation, cross validation, metric calculation, ensemble building

#### Automated Stock Trading via Interactive Brokers
- Data Streaming via Interactive Brokers and RabbitMQ
- Data Storage via time series database TimeScaleDb
- Containerisation of Interactive Brokers Software
- Container orchestration for 5 workers:
    1. retrieving live stock data from Interactive Brokers API
    2. cleaning and storing stock data
    3. calculating time series features and stock indicators
    4. execution of trading strategy
    5. live trading of stocks via Interactive Brokers API

#### Stock trading strategy based on Machine Learning models
- Various approaches to building a trading strategy that beats the market
- Usage of Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)
- Development of a full backtesting suite using real stock time series data

#### Prediction of Food Intolerances
- Data model design for various meals and ingredients
- Prediction of digestive conditions based on previously eaten meals

#### KnowNet Document Search Engine
- Development of a personal knowledge graph and graph based search engine that connects personal information (e.g. local or cloud files, emails and notes)
in a network of nodes and allows contextual full text search
- Leveraging of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Topic Modelling
- WebApp development using React, Node.js and hosting on Heroku
- Business Model development
- Application for an Exist Business Start-up Grant
