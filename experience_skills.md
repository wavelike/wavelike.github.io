## Projects

**End-to-end Machine Learning Platform**: Design and implementation

**Analytics**: Churn, sales, engagement, conversion and budget prediction, customer lifetime value (CLV), explainable models via Shap

**Funnel optimisation**: Predicting conversion probability of leads within the funnel

**Finance**: streamed stock price predictions and feature engineering

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Sentiment analysis, semantical search, sequence to sequence models

**Image classification**: ImageNet classifications and object detection

**Mail optimisation**: via multi-armed bandits

**Information retrieval** from knowledge graphs

**Big data risk reporting**: for a DAX company, using Spark, Kafka and Scala

**Food Intolerance detection**: Causality and effect estimation of eaten food on bodily pain

**Startup CTO tasks**: building of full tech stack including Backend, Frontend, Data Pipelines, ML models

## Models and algorithms

**tree models**: xgboost, catboost, lightgbm, ngboost, random forest

**deep learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, CNNs, LSTMs, attention models, TabNet

**NLP**: gensim, nltk, spacy, topic modelling

**bayesian methods**: Bayesian inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Bayesian AB tests

**multi-armed bandits** for stateless reinforcement learning

**custom loss functions**: for gradient boosted trees

**hyperparameter optimisation**: skopt

**feature selection**
