### 2017

Framework: D3 for Data Visualisation

Project: KnowNet Document Search Engine
- Development of a personal knowledge graph and graph based search engine that connects personal information (e.g. local or cloud files, emails and notes)
in a network of nodes and allows contextual full text search
- WebApp development using React, Node.js and hosting on Heroku
- Business Model development

Paper: PageRank

### 2016

Paper: **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**
- link

Frameworks: 
- Apache Spark (Scala)
- Kafka (Scala)

Project: Big Data Risk Reporting Platform
- Design and Implementation for a DAX company
- Programming Language: Scala

Master Thesis: 
- Modelling the global trade network: Nodes act as regional economical sectors (agriculture, automobile industry, etc.) and edges are trading routes between them
- This networks demand and supply can be perturbed by climatic extreme events (floods, droughts, tornados, etc.)
- Simulation of the distrubance propagation through the network 
- Application of Decision Trees to predict the most vulnerable network nodes
